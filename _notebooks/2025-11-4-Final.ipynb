    "Going into this class, I had almost zero knowledge of any type of code or tools. I am glad I joined this class because I learned so much. Now, I have learned lots of different things such as how to use github, different types of commands in JS and other terms like virtual environments and makefiles.\n",

    "\n",
    "The first key thing I learned was how to use tools in Kasm. An example of a tool that I learned about was how to use a **Venv** or **Virtual Enviironment**. This makes sure that your directory is isolated and seperate from different projects on the same machine. Another key thing I learned was how to use **Booleans** in sprint 2. They use true and false conditions and are often used for if statements. The last key point I learned was how to utilize **sprites** in a game. While working on our final sprint the mansion game, many people like my teammates Aarush and Jonah helped me understand and learn this concept.\n",
