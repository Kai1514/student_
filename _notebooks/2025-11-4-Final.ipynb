    "## Intro (Beginning of the Year)\n",
    "\n",
    "Going into this class, I had almost zero knowledge of any type of code or tools. I am glad I joined this class because I learned so much. Now, I have learned lots of different things such as how to use github, different types of commands in JS, how to use VScode, and other terms like virtual environments and makefiles.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Things from Sprints\n",
    "\n",
    "The first key thing I learned was how to use tools in Kasm. An example of a tool that I learned about was how to use a **Venv** or **Virtual Enviironment**. This makes sure that your directory is isolated and seperate from different projects on the same machine. Another key thing I learned was how to use **Booleans** in sprint 2. They use true and false conditions and are often used for if statements. The last key point I learned was how to utilize **sprites** in a game. While working on our final sprint the mansion game, many people like my teammates Aarush and Jonah helped me understand and learn this concept.\n",
    "\n",
    "## N@tM\n",
    "\n",
    "As my first year doing N@tM, I thought it was really fun and exciting to be able to present our team's work to various people. Some comments that we recieved that I really enjoyed hearing were **\"Nice effort and ideas\"** and **\"Nice game and concept but the animations could be a little smoother\"**. I think that these comments will help me improve myself in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Next Actions on Project\n",
    "\n",
    "For me, my next actions would be to try and rework our game so that it has less lag and runs smoother. Also, I would try and add more features such as upgrades, new weapons, and different enemies. I think that doing these will add a lot more life and depth into our project.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What to learn next?\n",
    "\n",
    "I would like to learn a lot more in CompSci in the future. I would definitely like to learn more and continue my journey in Computer Science. I really want to learn how to use some game engines like unreal because that is something that I have wanted to do for a while. I also would like to try and incorporate 3d modeling into my code. I feel like that would give it that extra edge over some others. I also think that making an online game would be extremely fun and awesome to learn how to do.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Something Cool\n",
    "\n",
    "Awhile ago, I learned how to code using minecraft online, I was able to create multiple mods that I think made the game 10x better. Some of the mods that I added were fire weapons, new mobs, and new weather. I really liked doing that project and I helped my fundamentals greatly. Another cool thing is that I have a lot of ideas for future projects. For example, I want to try to create a multiplayer online game sort of like minecraft, but 2d. I think that this will be a really fun, cool, and challenging project. I really am looking forward to what I can do and how my CompSci journey will be.\n"
